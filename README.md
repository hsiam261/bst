# Balanced Binary Search Trees
Balanced Binary Search Trees Written in C++.

This repo contains 3 different implementations of balanced binary search trees:
1) AVL Tree
2) Red-Black Tree
3) Splay Tree

All three implementations also has augmentation to support dynamic order statistic queries, namely
- `find_by_order(k)`: find the kth smallest element in the tree
- `order_by_key(k)`: how many elements in the tree are smaller than k?
